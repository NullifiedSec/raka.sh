# raka.sh The Simplest Shell in The World (Probably ðŸ˜…)

## What ?
This Is Just a Simple Project That I Plan To Update and Add Fetures Regularly
The Name Of This Project Is From My Little Sister's Name Raka

## Why ?
At This Point This Project Is Nothing Compared To All The Other Shells Like Bash Or Zsh
But In Future I Plan To Make It an Advance Shell It Will Be Like Vim Fully Keyboard Based.
You Dont Have To Touch Your Mouse If You Dont Want So That Is The Point Of raka.sh

## How ?
To Use This Just Download The rsh.py File Then Run This With 
```bash
python3 rsh.py
```
And There Is Also a Compiled Version Of It Just Download The `rsh` From The Releases Tab Then Run It With
```bash
chmod +x rsh
./rsh # python should be installed
```

and if you want to install this it with only one command then use this command
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NullifiedSec/raka.sh/main/setup.sh | bash
```
